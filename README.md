# Web application for posting pictures
I have made this project in order to get to know ASP.NET CORE platform. I wanted to practice my proggraming skills
and gain hands-on experience in building modern web applications using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework

## What I Learned

During this project, I got to know the MVC architecture. 
I applied Clean Achritecture principles to enhance code organization, used the Mediator pattern and CQRS using the MediatR library. 
I created a database using EntityFramework and integrated an authentication system through ASP.NET Identity.
I used FluentValidation to validate incoming models and AutoMapper to efficiently map and transfer data within the application.
